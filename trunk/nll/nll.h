/**
 @defgroup imaging

 This group defines the main algorithms for imaging such as volumes, interpolation and
 images.

 Often the library will use the concept of source and target volumes associated with affine transformation
 The "source" volume is a fixed volume, the "target" volume is the moving one. It is "moved" by an associated
 transformation (see multiplanar reconstruction). This associated transformation is ALWAYS given in the form source->target
 because this is how we display the volumes and it may not be possible to invert a transformation (or not efficiently, think
 about deformable tfm).

 @defgroup algorithm

 This group defines the main algorithms of the library. They are mainly decomposed into
 2 sub groups:
 - generic algorithm group, that tries to keep the dependencies to a minimum.
 - feature algorithm group, where it intregrates all the generic algorithms to
   the developped framework.
