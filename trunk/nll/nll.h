 @mainpage Numerical Learning Library
   The Numerical Learning Library intends to provide a wide range of machine learning
   and machine vision algorithms such as neural networks, support vector machine,
   hidden markcov model, clustering. It is a generic and efficient C++ library with
   its full integrated framework : feature creation, feature selection, feature
   transformation, preprocessing, classification and validation algorithms.

 @defgroup algorithm

 This group defines the main algorithms of the library. They are mainly decomposed into
 2 sub groups:
 - generic algorithm group, that tries to keep the dependencies to a minimum.
 - feature algorithm group, where it tries to intregrate all the generic algorithms to
   the developped framework.
