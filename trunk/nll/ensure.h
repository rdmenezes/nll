/**
 * @brief Ensure that the expression is true, else log the error and stop the program
          it can be turned off by setting the flag <code>NLL_NO_ENSURE</code>

   It is typically used to ensure that the program stays in a correct state for a developer version.
   However it should be disabled for a released version. It is different from <code>assert</code> since
   it won't really slow down the components as it is not used in internal loops/critical code.
