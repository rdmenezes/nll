    @brief Compute a 1D convolution

    Note that the behaviour on the data sides (i.e., +/- convolution.size() / 2) is to do an average of the
    kernel that fits inside the data.

    Complexity in time is o(NM) in processing and o(M+N) in size, with N = data size and M = convolution kernel size

    We are assuming the data has at least the size of the kernel.
