    @brief Independent Component Analysis, implementaing the FastICA algorithm

    Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statisticalmethod for transforming an observed multidimensional
    random vector into components that are statistically as independent from each other as possible. For example,
    there are several emitters and recepters, the recepters receive a mixed signal of recepters
    and ICA is trying to unmix this mixed signal.
    
    It is assumed that the emitters are not following a gaussian distribution (at maximum one can)

    it is implementing this paper: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/papers/TNN99new.pdf
