    @brief Locally linear embedding algorithm implementation

      Locally linear embedding (LLE) is an unsupervised learning algorithm
      that computes low dimensional, neighborhood preserving embeddings of high dimensional data.
      The data, assumed to be sampled from an underlying manifold, are mapped into a single global
      coordinate system of lower dimensionality. The mapping is derived from the symmetries of locally
      linear reconstructions, and the actual computation of the embedding reduces to a sparse eigenvalue
      problem. Notably, the optimizations in LLE—though capable of generating highly nonlinear
      embeddings—are simple to implement, and they do not involve local minima

      The trick is to do a different linear dimensionality reduction at each point
      (because locally a manifold looks linear) and then combine these with minimal discrepancy. It
      was introduced by Roweis and Saul (2000).

      This method is mainly aimed at displaying high dimentional data

      Note the implementation could be improved a lot by using sparse matrix and a SVD implementation
      working on sparse matrix that do not compute all the EIG/EIV but only the ones needed.

    @see http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume4/saul03a/saul03a.pdf (reference)
         http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/350/lectures/14/lecture-14.pdf for details

    @note it is not possible to project unseen points without recomputing the with the full set of points making
         impracticable to test previously unseen points. To overcome this point, an incremental algorithm can
         be implemented, or train a regression algorithm such as neural network to extrapolate to unseen points
