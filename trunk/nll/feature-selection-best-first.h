   /**
    @ingroup algorithm
    @brief Feature selection using a wrapper approach and a greedy algorithm. It will
           start with an empty set of feature. Each round, every feature not selected will
           be tested. The best feture will be added to the list of selected features and
           a new round will be started until the error is not lowered anymore by adding
           new features.
   
    only suitable for low dimensionality
    greedy search
