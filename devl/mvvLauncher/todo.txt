BUG:
- [NOT NECESSARY] fix: in console, layout = l2; => freeze... but if a new layout is created layout = Layout(segment2); then ok...
- [NOT NECESSARY] fix: remove volume from a MPR will displayed->the volume must be referenced in the order so that it is not reelased while threaded computations are not done yet
- [NOT NECESSARY] investigate: if different Layout are created on the same segment->problems (reseample) -> 1 segment cannot belong to 2 different layouts
- [DONE] fix: LUT: is not automatically updated if the LUT object is updated => in engine-mpr, the slice fusion is activated, but not slice to fuse...
- [DONE] fix: if volume is added on command line, segment is always refreshed
- [DONE] investigate: ToolAnnotations::AnnotationID   annotationsID[ 5 ] => should have type array...
- [DONE] fix: remove all volumes 'volumes', add new ones->MPR is not centred
- [DONE] fix: getVolume(ct) while CT volume is loading: threads are locked :/
- [DONE] if add annotations->segment & mip should be notified
- [DONE] if add/erase volume->update segments!
- [DONE] extend also to class def... class { int a[]={dsfds}}
- [DONE] import file with error => can't reimport it later on
- [DONE] check operator int n = 3.0 != 3; => operator associativity
- [DONE] add special characters for script
- [DONE] if variable declared in the wrong order -> we have the declaration and where it should be stored on the stack... but it will not be initialized, so access will fail!
- [DONE] wrong location/file in script error
- [DONE] check: variable that are initialized before use in case of mutual inclusion may be initialized twice
- investigate: ct.getVolume().getOrigin() generates a runtime exception
- investigate: annotations.clear() doesn't clear the MIP
- fix memleak in the orders

FEATURES TO BE ADDED:
- add registration matrix for volumes...
- add basic operations:
    - volume resampling
    - volume import/export
    - matrix & vector operations
    - get the list of annotations
    - controls: ctrl+l/r
    - cursor selection (mouse & keyboard)
    - history file
    - key binding in script
    - auto-completion / context auto-completion
    - copy/paste
    - scrollable windows
    - text editor
    - lut controls + script
