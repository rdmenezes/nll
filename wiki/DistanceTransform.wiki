#summary Basic manipulations and distance transform

= Tutorial 1: Image and Distance transform=

In this tutorial, the very basic operations on images will be covered:
  * loading/saving images
  * conversion float/char and greyscale/RGB images
  * apply a distance transform

A distance transform, also known as distance map or distance field, is a representation of an image. The map supplies each pixel of the image with the distance to the nearest obstacle pixel for a binary image.
